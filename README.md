# 💻 Jake’s Cyber Home Lab

## 📖 Overview

This repository documents the design, implementation, and iteration of a personal cybersecurity homelab built to develop hands-on experience with network security, virtualization, firewall configuration, and secure infrastructure design.

The lab is intentionally documented to be reproducible and educational, allowing others to follow the same process and learn from both the design decisions and lessons learned.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and implement a segmented network using industry-relevant tools
- Apply security best practices such as least privilege and network segmentation
- Gain hands-on experience with firewall configuration and traffic control
- Practice documenting technical systems clearly and accurately

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- pfSense (Firewall & routing)
- Proxmox (Virtualization)
- Kali Linux (Offensive security testing)
- Vulnerable lab services (e.g., OWASP Juice Shop)
- Managed network switch

---

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
- Network design and IP addressing
- VLAN configuration and segmentation
- Firewall rule design and validation
- Virtualization and lab orchestration
- Security-focused documentation and analysis
