# 🧪 CyberLab v2

This is the second iteration of my cybersecurity homelab, rebuilt to improve network design, documentation, and security posture based on lessons learned from v1.

## 📖 Summary
This iteration focuses on improved IP planning, network segmentation, and step-by-step reproducibility for learning purposes.

## 🗺️ Roadmap / Recommended Build Order

Follow these steps to replicate the lab:

1. **🏗️ 01 - Network Architecture**: Plan physical and logical network layout
2. **📐 02 - IP Schemes**: Plan IP ranges and VLANs 
3. **🔒 03 - Firewall Setup**: Configure pfSense with rules and routing  
4. **🖥️ 04 - Virtual Machines**: Deploy lab VMs on Proxmox  
5. **🌐 05 - Network Segmentation**: Apply VLANs and isolation  
6. **🛡️ 06 - Security Hardening**: Apply firewall hardening and monitoring  
7. **🧪 07 - Labs / Exercises**: Deploy vulnerable apps, capture traffic, analyze
